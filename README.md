# Swift Programming
  ## basic 
   - collections

   - Value types vs Reference types(different value and refeence memory allocation debt)
   - clouser (cleraify from malik)
## ARC, retain cycles, weak/unowned, memory leaks
## Protocol-oriented programming, Generics, ResultBuilder


#   iOS Concepts
## SceneDelegate & AppDelegate (App lifecycle (Foreground/Background states))
## threding and multi (malik 1 hour)
 ### basic understand threding concepte
  - basic runing concepts
  -  deadlock, race condiction ,aync, sync , paralism, concurrency
  - threds, nslock , dispach queue(need help malik how to run each code ), 
  - unterstand run loop , main threads 
  -DispatchQueue(group, workitem, barrier semphorne), OperationQueue 
  - RunLoop
  ###  async/await(suspension point, paralel async call, asyncsequence)
   - task (cancel, peroity, structure, unstucture, detched task)
    - actor (non isolator , global, main actor , Actor Reentrancy)(malik)
    - old api (closure call)
    - sendable
## Error handling (do-catch, try?, Result)
 ## commmuniction
   - KVO/KVC, Notifications, 
   - delegate patern
    - @pushisher, ObservedObject , EnvironmentObject,Environment, state,
     @Binding 
## URLSession and Networking

# UI Frameworks
* SwiftUI 
* UIKit (AutoLayout, TableView, CollectionView)
* Dynamic UI, Theming, Accessibility
* Custom transitions, animations, gestures

# Architecture (1 hour malik)
## MVC, MVVM, VIPER, Clean Architecture
 ## Dependency Injection
## design patern( Coordinators, build, adopt,facade ...)
  -
## SOLID principles


#  Data Persistence ()
* Core Data (NSFetchedResultsController, Migration)
* UserDefaults, Keychain, FileManager
* Codable, Plist, JSON
* SQLite/Realm (optional)

# Tools & DevOps
* Xcode Instruments: Time Profiler, Leaks, Allocations
* Fastlane, Bitrise, Jenkins
* TestFlight & App Store distribution

#  Testing
* XCTest: Unit & UI testing
* Mocking, Stubbing, Dependency Injection for testing
* Snapshot testing
* Code coverage

# Advanced Topics
* Deep linking (Universal links, custom URL schemes)
* Push notifications (APNs, Firebase)
* BLE, HomeKit, HealthKit (domain-specific)
* App security: Jailbreak detection, certificate pinning
* AppStore submission policies & review process

 #  System Design for Mobile
* Modular architecture in large-scale apps
* How to design a scalable feature (like Chat, News Feed)
* Offline first architecture
* How to sync background tasks with the server
* Caching strategy
* Folder/project structure
* Code reusability across apps (e.g. shared frameworks)



‚úÖ Practice:
* "Design a video streaming app"
* "Design an offline notes app"
* "Design your app‚Äôs login and session management system"

üîê 4. Behavioral + Soft Skills
* STAR Method: Situation, Task, Action, Result
* Leadership, mentorship examples
* Conflict resolution in team
* Communication across QA, backend, and product
Prepare for:
* ‚ÄúTell me about a difficult bug you fixed.‚Äù
* ‚ÄúHave you ever disagreed with a PM or designer?‚Äù
* ‚ÄúHow do you ensure code quality across a team?‚Äù

# . Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) - ajeeth ( 2 hour)
Especially for FAANG or product companies
Focus Topics:
* Arrays, Strings, LinkedLists, Stacks, Queues
* HashMaps, Sets
* Trees (BST, N-ary, Trie basics)
* Graphs (BFS/DFS)
* Sorting and Searching (Binary Search, QuickSort)
* Dynamic Programming (Top-down and bottom-up)
Platforms:
* LeetCode: Easy to Medium (100+ practice)
* HackerRank, InterviewBit
* Emphasize space/time complexity analysis
